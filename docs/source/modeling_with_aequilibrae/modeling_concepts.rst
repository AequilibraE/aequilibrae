Modeling Concepts
=================

Modeling with AequilibraE is not dissimilar than modeling with traditional commercial packages,
as we strive to make it as easy as possible for seasoned modelers to migrate their models and
workflows to AequilibraE.

Although modeling with AequilibraE should feel somewhat familiar to seasoned modelers, especially
those used to programming, the mechanics of some of AequilibraE procedures might be foreign to
some of users, so this section of the documentation will include discussions of the mechanics
of some of these procedures and some light discussion on its motivation.

Further, many AequilibraE users are new to the *craft*, so we have elected to start
creating documentation on the most important topics in the transportation modeling practice, where
we detail how these concepts are translated into the AequilibraE tools and recommended workflows.
