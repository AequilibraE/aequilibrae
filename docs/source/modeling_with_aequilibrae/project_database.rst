Project database
----------------
More details on the **project_database.sqlite** are discussed on a nearly *per-table*
basis below, and we recommend understanding the role of each table before setting
an AequilibraE model you intend to use in anger.

   project_database/about
   project_database/network
   project_database/modes
   project_database/link_types
   project_database/matrices
   project_database/zones
   project_database/parameters_metadata
   project_database/results


A more technical view of the database structure, including the SQL queries used to
create each table and the indices used for each table are also available.
