Transit assignment
==================

Transit assignment models are mathematical tools that predict how passengers
behave and travel in a transit network, given some assumptions and inputs.

Transit assignment models aim to answer questions such as: 

- *How do transit passengers choose their routes in a complex network of lines and services?*
- *How can we estimate the distribution of passenger flows and the performance of transit systems?*

In the following sections, we'll present the ``TransitGraph``, the graph structure used for a transit
network, and the hyperpath routing for transit assignment.
