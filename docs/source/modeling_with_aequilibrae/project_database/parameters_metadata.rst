Parameters metadata table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation is paramount for any successful modeling project. For this reason,
AequilibraE has a database table dedicated to the documentation of each field in
each of the other tables in the project. This table, called
**attributes_documentation** can be accessed directly through SQL, but it is
envisaged that its editing and consultation would happen through the Python API
itself.
