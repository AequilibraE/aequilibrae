Development Roadmap
===================

As AequilibraE is a project with an incredibly small team and very little external
funding, it is not feasible to determine a precise schedule for the development
of new features or even a detailed roadmap.

However, there are a number of enhancements to the software that we have already
identified and that we intend to dedicate some time to in the future.

* Network data model

    * Introduce centroid connector data type to replace the inference that all links
      connected to centroids are connectors

* Traffic assignment

    * Re-development of the path-finding algorithm to allow for turn
      penalties/bans
    * New origin-based traffic assignment to achieve ultra-converged
      assignment
    * New path-finding algorithm based on contraction-hierarchies

* Public Transport

    * Export of GTFS (enables editing of GTFS in QGIS)
    * Public transit assignment (Scheduled for 3rd Quarter 2023)

* Project

    * Inclusion of new table for scalar values
    * Inclusion of new table for vectors based on centroid IDs (plus metadata
      table)
    * Inclusion of new table for vectors based on node IDs (plus metadata table)
    * Inclusion of new table for vectors based on link IDs (plus metadata table)

* QGIS

    * Inclusion of TSP and more general vehicle routing problems (resource
      constraints, pick-up, and delivery, etc.)

If there is any other feature you would like to suggest, please record a new
issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/AequilibraE/aequilibrae/issues>`_, or drop
us a line.

If your organization is making use of AequilibraE, please consider funding some
of the new developments or maintenance of the project.
