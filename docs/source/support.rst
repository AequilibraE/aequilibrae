Support
=======

AequilibraE is developed by a small but dedicated team of professionals with
limited funding.

Free support
------------

There are two mechanisms to obtain free support that also allow you to check whether your question was
already asked in the past, with the the first option being the most often used as of December/2023:

1. Joining the `AequilibraE Google Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/aequilibrae>`_
   and sending your question there.
2. Posting your question to `GIS StackOverflow <https://gis.stackexchange.com/>`_ using the #aequilibrae tag;

Please note that all questions and answers in both forums are public.
