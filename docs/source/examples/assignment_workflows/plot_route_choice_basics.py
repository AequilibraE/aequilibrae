Route Choice
============

In this example, we show how to perform route choice set generation using BFSLE and Link penalisation, for a city in La
Serena Metropolitan Area in Chile.

# Model parameters

# We'll set the parameters for our route choice model. These are the parameters that will be used to calculate the
