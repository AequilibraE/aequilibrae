Route Choice set generation
===========================

In this example, we show how to generate route choice sets for estimation of route choice models, using a
a city in La Serena Metropolitan Area in Chile.

# Route Choice class
# ------------------

# This object construct might take a minute depending on the size of the graph due to the construction of the
# compressed link to network link mapping that's required. This is a one time operation per graph and is cached. We
# need to supply a Graph and an AequilibraeMatrix or DataFrame via the ``add_demand`` method, if demand is not provided
# link loading cannot be preformed.

# %%
# Here we'll set the parameters of our set generation. There are two algorithms available: Link penalisation, and BFSLE
# based on the paper
# `"Route choice sets for very high-resolution data" <https://doi.org/10.1080/18128602.2012.671383>`_ 
# by Nadine Rieser-Sch√ºssler, Michael Balmer & Kay W. Axhausen (2013).
#
# Our BFSLE implementation has been extended to allow applying link penalisation as well. Every
# link in all routes found at a depth are penalised with the `penalty` factor for the next depth. 
# So at a depth of 0 no links are penalised nor removed. At depth 1, all links found at depth 0 are penalised, 
# then the links marked for removal are removed. All links in the routes found at depth 1 are then penalised 
# for the next depth. The penalisation compounds. Pass set ``penalty=1.0`` to disable.
#
# It is highly recommended to set either ``max_routes`` or ``max_depth`` to prevent runaway results.

# rc.set_choice_set_generation("link-penalisation", max_routes=5, penalty=1.02)

# %%
# The 5% penalty (1.05) is likely a little too large, but it create routes that are distinct enough to make this simple
# example more interesting
