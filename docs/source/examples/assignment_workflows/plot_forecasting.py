Forecasting
===========

In this example, we present a full forecasting workflow for the Sioux Falls example model.

We start creating the skim matrices, running the assignment for the base-year, and then
distributing these trips into the network. Later, we estimate a set of future demand vectors
which are going to be the input of a future year assignnment with select link analysis.
