# Model parameters
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# We'll set the parameters for our route choice model. These are the parameters that will be used to calculate the
# utility of each path. In our example, the utility is equal to *theta* * distance
# And the path overlap factor (PSL) is equal to *beta*.

# Distance factor
theta=0.011

# PSL parameter
beta = 1.1

# This object construct might take a minute depending on the size of the graph due to the construction of the compressed
# link to network link mapping that's required.  This is a one time operation per graph and is cached. We need to
# supply a Graph and optionally a AequilibraeMatrix, if the matrix is not provided link loading cannot be preformed.

# Here we'll set the parameters of our set generation. There are two algorithms available: Link penalisation, or BFSLE
# based on the paper
# "Route choice sets for very high-resolution data" by Nadine Rieser-SchÃ¼ssler, Michael Balmer & Kay W. Axhausen (2013).
# https://doi.org/10.1080/18128602.2012.671383
#
# Our BFSLE implementation is slightly different and has extended to allow applying link penalisation as well. Every
# link in all routes found at a depth are penalised with the `penalty` factor for the next depth. So at a depth of 0 no
# links are penalised nor removed. At depth 1, all links found at depth 0 are penalised, then the links marked for
# removal are removed. All links in the routes found at depth 1 are then penalised for the next depth. The penalisation
# compounds. Pass set `penalty=1.0` to disable.
#
# To assist in filtering out bad results during the assignment, a `cutoff_prob` parameter can be provided to exclude
# routes from the path-sized logit model. The `cutoff_prob` is used to compute an inverse binary logit and obtain a max
# difference in utilities. If a paths total cost is greater than the minimum cost path in the route set plus the max
# difference, the route is excluded from the PSL calculations. The route is still returned, but with a probability of
# 0.0.
#
# The `cutoff_prob` should be in the range [0, 1]. It is then rescaled internally to [0.5, 1] as probabilities below 0.5
# produce negative differences in utilities. A higher `cutoff_prob` includes more routes. A value of `0.0` will only
# include the minimum cost route. A value of `1.0` includes all routes.
#
# It is highly recommended to set either `max_routes` or `max_depth` to prevent runaway results.
