# Model parameters
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# We'll set the parameters for our route choice model. These are the parameters that will be used to calculate the
# utility of each path. In our example, the utility is equal to *theta* * distance
# And the path overlap factor (PSL) is equal to *beta*.

# Automated sub-area analysis
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# We first construct out SubAreaAnalysis object from the graph, zones, and matrix we previously constructed, then
# configure the route choice assignment and execute it. From there the `post_process` method is able to use the route
# choice assignment results to construct the desired demand matrix as a DataFrame.
