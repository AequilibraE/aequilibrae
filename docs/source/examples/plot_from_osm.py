"""
Project from Open-Street Maps
=============================

On this example we show how to create an empty project and populate with a network from Open-Street maps

But this time we will use Folium to visualize the network

## Imports

from os.path import join
from aequilibrae import Project
import folium

# %%
# We create an empty project on an arbitrary folder

# %%
# Now we can download the network from any place in the world (as long as you have memory for all the download
# and data wrangling that will be done)

# We can create from a bounding box
# or from a named place. For the sake of this example, we will choose the small nation of Nauru

# We grab all the links data as a Pandas dataframe so we can process it easier

# We create a Folium layer

# We do some Python magic to transform this dataset into the format required by Folium
# We are only getting link_id and link_type into the map, but we could get other pieces of info as well
