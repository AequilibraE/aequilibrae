Route Choice
=================

In this example, we show how to perform route choice set generation using BFSLE and Link penalisation, for a city in La Serena Metropolitan Area in Chile.

# To perform a batch operation we need to prepare the object first. We can either provide a list of tuple of the OD pairs we'd like to use, or we can provided a 1D list
