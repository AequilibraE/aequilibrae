Creating a zone system based on Hex Bins
========================================

In this example, we show how to create hex bin zones covering an arbitrary area.

We use the Nauru example to create roughly 100 zones covering the whole modeling
area as delimited by the entire network

You are obviously welcome to create whatever zone system you would like, as long as
you have the geometries for them. In that case, you can just skip the hex bin computation
part of this notebook.

We also add centroid connectors to our network to make it a pretty complete example

# Hex Bins using Spatialite
# -------------------------

# %%
# Spatialite requires a few things to compute hex bins.
# One of them is the area you want to cover.
network = project.network

# %%
# So we use the convenient network method ``convex_hull()`` (it may take some time for very large networks)
geo = network.convex_hull()

# %%
# The second thing is the side of the hex bin, which we can compute from its area.
# The approximate area of the desired hex bin is
zone_area = geo.area / zones

# %%
# Since the area of the hexagon is **3 * sqrt(3) * side^2 / 2**
# is side is equal to  **sqrt(2 * sqrt(3) * A/9)**
zone_side = sqrt(2 * sqrt(3) * zone_area / 9)

# %%
# Now we can run an SQL query to compute the hexagonal grid.
# There are many ways to create hex bins (including with a GUI on QGIS), but we find that
# using SpatiaLite is a pretty neat solution.
# For which we will use the entire network bounding box to make sure we cover everything
extent = network.extent()

)
grid = curr.fetchone()[0]
grid = shapely.wkb.loads(grid)

# %%
# Since we used the bounding box, we have WAY more zones than we wanted, so we clean them
# by only keeping those that intersect the network convex hull.
grid = [p for p in grid.geoms if p.intersects(geo)]

# %%
# Let's re-number all nodes with IDs smaller than 300 to something bigger as to free space to our centroids to go from 1
# to N
nodes = network.nodes
for i in range(1, 301):
    nd = nodes.get(i)
    nd.renumber(i + 1300)

# %%
# Now we can add them to the model
# And add centroids to them while we are at it

    zone = zoning.new(i + 1)
    zone.geometry = zone_geo

# Centroid connectors
# -------------------

    # We also specify the link types we accept to connect to (can be used to avoid connection to ramps or freeways)
    zone.connect_mode(mode_id="c", link_types="ytrusP", connectors=2)

    # This takes a few minutes to compute, so we will break after processing the first 10 zones
    if zone_id >= 10:
        break

# %%
# Let's add special generator zones
# We also add a centroid at the airport terminal
nodes = project.network.nodes

# %%
# Let's use some silly number for its ID, like 10,000, just so we can easily differentiate it
airport = nodes.new_centroid(10000)
airport.geometry = Point(166.91749582, -0.54472590)
airport.save()

# %%
# When connecting a centroid not associated with a zone, we need to tell AequilibraE what is the initial area around
# the centroid that needs to be considered when looking for candidate nodes.
# Distance here is in degrees, so 0.01 is equivalent to roughly 1.1km
