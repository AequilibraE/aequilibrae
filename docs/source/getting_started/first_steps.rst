First steps
===========

AequilibraE is a python package for transportation modeling. To take full
advantage of its capacities, it would be great if you already have a little
knowledge on transportation modeling. If you're totaly new to the area,
we encourage you to do some research on your own or take a look in some useful
books and research papers in the :ref:`useful links <useful_links>` session.

If you're already feeling confortable with some transportation modeling concepts,
you can move on to :ref:`creating your first AequilibraE model <examples_creating_models>`.
