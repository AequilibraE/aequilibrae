First steps
===========

AequilibraE is a python package for transportation modeling. To take full
advantage of its capacities, it would be great if you already have a little
knowledge on transportation modeling. If you're totaly new to the area,
you can either continue to the next session with a transportation modeling
101 or to any of our :ref:`useful links <useful_links>`.

If you're already feeling confortable with transportation modeling concepts,
you can move on to :ref:`creating your first AequilibraE model <create_your_first_model>`.
