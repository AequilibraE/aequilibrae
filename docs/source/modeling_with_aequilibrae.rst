Modeling with AequilibraE
=========================

AequilibraE is the first fully-featured Python package for transportation
modeling, and it aims to provide all the resources not easily available from
other open-source packages in the Python (NumPy, really) ecosystem.

AequilibraE has also a fully features interface available as a plugin for the
open source software QGIS, which is separately maintained and discussed in
detail its `documentation <http://www.aequilibrae.com/qgis>`_.

Contributions are welcome to the existing modules and/or in the form of new modules.

In this section you can find a deep dive into modeling with AequilibraE, from
a start guide to a complete view into AequilibraE's data structure.
